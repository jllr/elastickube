ElasticKube is a management layer on top of a Kubernetes cluster, a web console and self-service template catalog of all the containerized services that are available in your repository (for example, GitHub).

Our primary focus is to add value with authorization and user management which allows for visibility into who has done what and historical behaviors within the environment. Additional capabilities are built on the same concept that Kubernetes uses; you can manage resources, templates, charts and namespaces while also providing both a user and admin portal.
